</p>



Welcome to the 8051 Microcontroller Tutorials repository! This repository contains a collection of tutorials and practical examples focused on programming ATMEL 8051 Series Microcontrollers (AT89C51/AT89S51/AT89S52...) using Assembly language. The examples are simulated in Proteus and verified on real hardware. <br/>

üöÄ Overview
This repository is designed to help beginners and enthusiasts learn the fundamentals of 8051 programming and circuit simulation. <br/>



Each tutorial provides a step-by-step guide for programming the 8051 microcontroller in Assembly, simulating it using Proteus, and downloading the compiled program to hardware via avrdudes. <br/>

‚ú® Features
Comprehensive 8051 Assembly tutorials for various peripherals
Ready-to-use Proteus simulation files
Well-commented Assembly code for easier learning
Practical interfacing examples like LEDs, motors, and displays
Tutorials on UART communication, ADC interfacing, and more <br/>

üì¶ Getting Started
Requirements:
Software:
MIDE-51 ‚Äì A powerful IDE for writing and compiling Assembly code for the 8051 microcontroller.
avrdudes ‚Äì A tool for uploading compiled programs to the hardware.
Proteus Design Suite ‚Äì A professional-grade circuit simulation software for visualizing and testing your designs before actual hardware implementation.
Hardware:
MK-51S Microcontroller Development Kit ‚Äì A dedicated development board for the AT89S51/52 microcontroller series to practice real-world interfacing and application design.
Note: Don‚Äôt have a development board? No worries! You can still follow along by using a USBasp Programmer, along with basic components and breadboards for hands-on practice with the examples.

<br/>
Installation
Clone this repository:

bash
