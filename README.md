### Steps to Use AVRDude with USBasp:
Here‚Äôs a guide on how to use **AVRDude** with the **USBasp** programmer to upload code to the 8051 microcontroller.

---

#### 1. **Install AVRDude**:
   - **Windows**: Download AVRDude and install it by following the instructions from [AVRDude on GitHub](https://github.com/avrdudes/avrdude) or using a package manager like [WinAVR](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winavr/).
   - **Linux/macOS**: Use a package manager (e.g., `apt-get install avrdude` for Ubuntu/Debian or `brew install avrdude` for macOS).

#### 2. **Install USBasp Driver (for Windows)**:
   - Download and install **Zadig** from [Zadig Installer](https://zadig.akeo.ie/).
   - Open Zadig, select your **USBasp** device from the list, and install the **libusbK** driver.

#### 3. **Prepare Your Code**:
   - Write your **Assembly** code using a tool like **MIDE-51**.
   - Compile the Assembly code into a `.hex` file.

#### 4. **Connect Your USBasp to the 8051 Microcontroller**:
   - Make sure the USBasp is properly connected to your development board or the microcontroller's ISP pins. You'll need to connect the following pins:
     - **MOSI**, **MISO**, **SCK**, **RST**, **VCC**, **GND**.

#### 5. **Use AVRDude Command to Upload Code**:
   AVRDude uses the following syntax to program microcontrollers:

   ```bash
   avrdude -c usbasp -p <device> -U flash:w:<your_hex_file.hex>
   ```

   - `-c usbasp`: Specifies that you're using a USBasp programmer.
   - `-p <device>`: Specify your microcontroller (e.g., `-p m8051` for the AT89S51/AT89C51 microcontroller).
   - `-U flash:w:<your_hex_file.hex>`: This tells AVRDude to write the `.hex` file to the microcontroller's flash memory.

   Example command:

   ```bash
   avrdude -c usbasp -p m89s52 -U flash:w:myprogram.hex
   ```

#### 6. **Check for Errors**:
   After running the command, AVRDude will communicate with the USBasp programmer to upload the program to the 8051 microcontroller. You should see a success message if the upload was completed without any issues.

#### 7. **Verifying the Flash**:
   To verify that the code was successfully written to the 8051‚Äôs memory, you can use:

   ```bash
   avrdude -c usbasp -p m89s52 -U flash:v:myprogram.hex
   ```

   This will read the flash memory and compare it with your `.hex` file.

---

### Example Workflow:

1. **Write and compile your Assembly code** in MIDE-51 or any other IDE.
2. **Connect the USBasp programmer** to the 8051 development board.
3. **Use AVRDude** to upload the compiled `.hex` file:

   ```bash
   avrdude -c usbasp -p m89s52 -U flash:w:mycode.hex
   ```

4. **Verify the upload** (optional):

   ```bash
   avrdude -c usbasp -p m89s52 -U flash:v:mycode.hex
   ```

Now, the microcontroller should be programmed and running your uploaded code.
