## üöÄ **Overview**

<p align="justify">
8051 microcontroller is designed by Intel in 1981. It is an 8-bit microcontroller. It is built with 40 pins DIP (dual inline package), 4kb of ROM storage and 128 bytes of RAM storage, 2 16-bit timers. It consists of are four parallel 8-bit ports, which are programmable as well as addressable as per the requirement.
</p>

##   PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE FOR THE 8051:

It depends on you which one you choose to program 8051 family of micro controllers as they can be programmed in assembly language as well as in ‚ÄúC‚Äù or we can say ‚ÄúEmbedded C‚Äù


Assembly Language is a pseudo-English representation of the Machine Language. The 8051 Microcontroller Assembly Language is a combination of English like words called Mnemonics and Hexadecimal codes. It is also a low level language and requires extensive understanding of the architecture of the Microcontroller.

The best languages for programming the 8051 microcontroller are:

Assembly Language:
- Pros: Direct control over hardware, efficient use of memory and processing power, and fast execution speed.
- Cons: Steeper learning curve and more complex code management.
C Language:
- Pros: Easier to write and maintain than assembly, good level of abstraction, and widely supported with various libraries and tools.
- Cons: Slightly less efficient than assembly in terms of speed and memory usage.
C++:
- Pros: Object-oriented features can help in managing larger projects, and it still allows for low-level hardware access.
- Cons: More complex than C, and might not be supported by all compilers for 8051.
Recommendation

For most applications, C is often recommended due to its balance of efficiency, ease of use, and maintainability. However, if you need maximum performance and control, Assembly Language is the way to go.

For Example, assume that an LED is connected to 8051 microcontroller on an I/O pin (e.g., P1.0), then here is the code for blinking the LED  of the 8051 microcontroller in both Assembly and C language shown below:

### **Assembly Code (8051)**

```asm
ORG 00H           ; Start at address 0
MAIN:             ; Main program label
    SETB P1.0     ; Set P1.0 (Turn LED off assuming active low)
    ACALL DELAY   ; Call delay subroutine
    CLR P1.0      ; Clear P1.0 (Turn LED on)
    ACALL DELAY   ; Call delay subroutine
    SJMP MAIN     ; Jump back to main (infinite loop)

; Delay subroutine
DELAY:    
    MOV R1, #250  ; Load R1 with 250
DELAY_LOOP1:
    MOV R2, #250  ; Load R2 with 250
DELAY_LOOP2:
    DJNZ R2, DELAY_LOOP2  ; Decrement R2 and jump if not zero
    DJNZ R1, DELAY_LOOP1  ; Decrement R1 and jump if not zero
    RET                     ; Return to the main program

END                ; End of program
```

### **Explanation (Assembly Code):**
- **P1.0:** This is the pin on Port 1 used to control the LED.
- **SETB P1.0:** Turns the LED off (if it‚Äôs active low, i.e., LED is turned on when the pin is low).
- **CLR P1.0:** Turns the LED on.
- **DELAY:** Subroutine to provide a simple delay. The delay is implemented using two nested loops.

### **C Code (8051)**

```c
#include <reg51.h>  // Header file for 8051 microcontroller

sbit LED = P1^0;    // Define LED on P1.0

void delay(void);   // Function declaration for delay

void main() {
    while (1) {     // Infinite loop
        LED = 0;    // Turn on LED (active low)
        delay();    // Call delay function
        LED = 1;    // Turn off LED
        delay();    // Call delay function
    }
}

void delay(void) {
    unsigned int i, j;
    for (i = 0; i < 250; i++) {
        for (j = 0; j < 250; j++) {
            // Do nothing, just waste some time
        }
    }
}
```

### **Explanation (C Code):**
- **sbit LED = P1^0:** Defines the bit that controls the LED connected to pin P1.0.
- **LED = 0;** Turns the LED on (assuming it's active low).
- **LED = 1;** Turns the LED off.
- **delay():** A simple delay function that uses two nested loops to create a delay.

Both codes will blink an LED connected to P1.0 of the 8051 microcontroller.
