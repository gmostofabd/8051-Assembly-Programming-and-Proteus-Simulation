## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**

To follow along with the tutorials, you'll need:

- [MIDE-51](https://www.opcube.com/) as the **editor and compiler** for Assembly programming.
- [avrdudes](http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/avrdude) to **download the program** to the hardware.
- [Proteus Design Suite](https://www.labcenter.com/downloads/) for **circuit simulation**.
- A basic understanding of **microcontrollers** and **Assembly language**.

### **Installation**

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/8051-microcontroller-tutorials.git
   ```

2. Open the **Assembly code files** in **MIDE-51** and compile them.
3. Use **avrdudes** to download the compiled program to your hardware.
4. Import the **Proteus simulation files** into **Proteus Design Suite** and run the simulation.
